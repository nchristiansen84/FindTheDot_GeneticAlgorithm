# FindTheDot_GeneticAlgorithm
Followed a tutorial by CodeBullet to learn more about genetic algorithms. Also learning Processing as it seems to be a language with easy GUI so I can focus on the program aspect.

Made slight modifications to the tutorial:
- Added class for the goal to it would be easier to use in more cases
- Added class for a single barrier and a class for all of the barriers in order to test the algorithm more and play around with it
